// let vs var vs const 
// var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped 
// while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated
// and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; 
// const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope.
